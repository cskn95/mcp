# Cannot find lucide-react module (2025-07-20 11:12Z)

cannot find 'lucide-react' module

_**Assistant**_

The error "Cannot find module 'lucide-react' or its corresponding type declarations" means that the lucide-react package is not installed in your project. To fix this, you need to install it.

Hereâ€™s how to resolve the issue:

1. Open your terminal in the project root directory.
2. Run the following command to install lucide-react:

```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

If you are using TypeScript and want type support (lucide-react is written in TypeScript, so no extra types are needed), just installing the package is enough.

After installing, the error should disappear. If you still see the error, try restarting your development server or your editor.

Would you like me to run the installation command for you?

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Parameter 'e' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

To resolve the error "Parameter 'e' implicitly has an 'any' type," you should explicitly type the event parameter. Since this is a click event on an anchor element, use:

```ts
const smoothScroll = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLAnchorElement>) => {
```

This will fix the TypeScript error.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
No overload matches this call.
  The last overload gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'string | null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
      Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

You need to ensure that `href` is not null before passing it to `document.querySelector`.  
A concise fix is:

```ts
const href = e.currentTarget.getAttribute('href');
if (!href) return;
const element = document.querySelector(href);
if (element) {
  element.scrollIntoView({
    behavior: 'smooth',
    block: 'start'
  });
  setIsMenuOpen(false);
}
```

This checks that `href` is a string before using it.
